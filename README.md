# 42 School - Reverse Shell

The repository contains a snapshot of a program I developed during the programming bootcamp of the 42 school at Paris, held in July 2019. It should be noted that the program, while referred to as a "virus" was not intended to cause harm or inconvenience to others.

> The files in this repository have unconventional and peculiar names such as ".mac.sh" and ".macoxMem.sh". These names were intentionally chosen during the development phase in 2019, as I was experimenting with different approaches. As a beginner at that time, I was exploring ways to make the program less predictable and stand out from typical naming conventions. However, it is important to note that using meaningful and descriptive names is generally recommended for better code comprehension and maintainability.
